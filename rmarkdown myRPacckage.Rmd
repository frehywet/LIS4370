## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

load required library
```{r, "step 1" }
library(lorem)

```
write code for function
```{r, "step 2" }
count_vowels <- function(sentence) {
  vowels <- c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", "I", "O", "U")
  vowel_count <- 0
}
  

```
test output
```{r, "step 3" }
sentence <- as.character(ipsum(1))
sentence
num_vowels <- count_vowels(sentence)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
